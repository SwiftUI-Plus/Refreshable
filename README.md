# Refreshable

> Also available as a part of my [SwiftUI+ Collection](https://benkau.com/packages.json) â€“ just add it to Xcode 13+

A backport of the new `refreshable` modifier with support for all SwiftUI versions.

This includes support for a `refreshAction` in the `Environment` as well as a convenient `RefreshableView` that makes it easy to build your own trigger's for _any_ refresh action.

> Note: This package does not (_yet_) include a pull-to-refresh like component.

## Example

To avoid naming issues, the modifier is called `onRefresh` and to provide a familiar API for ending the refresh, the closure returns a `Refresh` instance that can be used (similary to `presentationMode`), to notify the UI that it should stop refreshing.

```swift
ScrollView {
    // content
}
.onRefresh { refresh in
    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { _, _, _ in
        refresh.wrappedValue.end()
    }
}
```

Then, to provide some UI that triggers the refresh:

```swift
RefreshableView { phase in
    switch phase {
    case let .idle(refresher, action):
        Button {
            refresher.perform(action)
        } label: {
            Text(title)
        }
    case .refreshing:
        ProgressView()
    case .notSupported:
        // `onRefresh` modifier has not been added
        Text("Not refreshable")
    }
}
```

## Installation

The code is packaged as a framework. You can install manually (by copying the files in the `Sources` directory) or using Swift Package Manager (**preferred**)

To install using Swift Package Manager, add this to the `dependencies` section of your `Package.swift` file:

`.package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftUI-Plus/Refreshable.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "1.0.0"))`

## Other Packages

If you want easy access to this and more packages, add the following collection to your Xcode 13+ configuration:
